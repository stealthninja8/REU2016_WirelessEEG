#REU2016_WirelessEEG

####To determine if we can use the dry wireless EEG effectively, we need to consider several questions: How does the dry wireless EEG compare to the standard EEG (Biosemi)? Does it reliably measure brain activity, both during rest and functional movement? And if so, can we apply the same data analysis techniques to the wireless EEG's data as we do to the Biosemi's?

##Instructions for Running:
The Java program for marking and analyzing the kinematic data runs through a simple GUI. You must download the project and have a recent JDK installed in order to run this.

Once downloaded as a .zip file, extract the contents to your desired location.

###To run through an IDE (such as NetBeans or Eclipse):
Open EEG_app.java in your IDE and run from there.

###To run from the command line:
Navigate to the location of the extracted files, and enter the eeggui folder.
<pre><code>
javac *.java
</code></pre>
Exit the eeggui subdirectory and then:
<pre><code>
java eeggui.EEG_app
</code></pre>

<i>Obviously the best group :)</i>
