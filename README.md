#REU2016_WirelessEEG

####To determine if we can use the dry wireless EEG effectively, we need to consider several questions: How does the dry wireless EEG compare to the standard EEG (Biosemi)? Is it effective at analyzing brain activity, and if so, does gait skew the acquired data? And if it gathers reliable data, can we apply the same data analysis techniques to the wireless EEG's data as we do to the Biosemi's?

<i>Obviously the best group :)</i>
