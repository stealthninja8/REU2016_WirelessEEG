#REU2016_WirelessEEG

####To determine if we can use the dry wireless EEG effectively, we need to consider several questions: How does the dry wireless EEG compare to the standard EEG (Biosemi)? Does it reliably measure brain activity, both during rest and functional movement? And if so, can we apply the same data analysis techniques to the wireless EEG's data as we do to the Biosemi's?

<i>Obviously the best group :)</i>
